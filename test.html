                        <p class = "fw4 lh-copy">Jumbocode is a Tufts student-run club that provides software services for local non-profit organizations. For the 2017-2018 school year I worked as the lead UX designer on a team of 10 to create a  mobile app for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.</p>

        <div class = "background f5 w-60 sans-serif fn mt5 tj center cf fade lh-copy">
            <p>During the cold winter months the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter sends out a Street Team to provide assistance to those in need who cannot make it to the shelter. This assistance can take the form of providing food and supplies or helping to call in to the shelter's lottery system.</p>

            <p>Before coming to Jumbocode, the Street team data and notes system was fairly inefficient: volunteers would take binders of resources and notepads out on the streets and compiled the notes at the end of the night. Due to the number of things the street teamers have to keep track of, it is not uncommon for them to forget by the time they have to record logs.</p>

            <p>In order to streamline the note taking process as well as make things run more smoothly for volunteers, our JumboCode team was tasked with creating a mobile app for the shelter.
