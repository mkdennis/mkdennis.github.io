            <p>The people with the best self control are typically the ones who need to use it least. It‚Äôs easier to practice self restraint when you don‚Äôt have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. 

            Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Reduce friction for good behaviors you want to adopt , increase friction for bad behaviors</p>
            <br>
            <p>People often think it‚Äôs weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, <b>a habit must be established before it can be improved</b>
            (e.g. go run 1.5 miles everyday for a week vs step outside early in morning everyday for a week vs put on running shoes right after waking up everyday for a week)</p>

            <h3>Don't criticize, condemn or complain</h3>
            <p>Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</p>
            <p>B.F. Skinner, the world famous psychologist, proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that the same applies for humans. By criticising, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.</p>
            <p>Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, "As much as we thirst for approval, we dread condemnation."</p>
            <p>When dealing with people, let us remember <b>we are not ealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion,</b> creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>An Easy Way to Become a Good Conversationalist: Be a good listener.</h3>
                <p>To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage others to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.</p>
                <p>Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than tey are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people.</p>
                <p>"Many persons call a doctor when all tey want is an audience." - Reader's Digest</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Principle: Become genuinely interested in other people</h3>
            <p>"It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficuties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."</p>
