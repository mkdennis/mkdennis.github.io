                <p>We authorize you to proceed with the developing initial UI design concepts for an iPad-optimized Boston
                    Marathon app. As we explained during our initial meeting, we want to create an iPad application that is
                    distinct from our current mobile application and is more geared to people who want to follow-along from
                    home. For now, you can assume the application will run on the current generation iPad (9.7″ Retina
                    display with 2048×1536 resolution)."</p>
                    <p>- Ability to enter up to 50 bib numbers and track their progress</p>
                    <p>- An interactive map that shows the position of any runner you are tracking in real-time</p>
                    <p>- View a countdown to the start of the race</p>
                    <p>- Have runner profiles with mile split times + charity they are running for</p>

                <p>Please proceed to develop initial user interface concepts for the GE-IQ Smart Fridge Mobile App. As background, the GE-IQ Smart Fridge series refrigerators will be an internet-connected fridge with a 22” diagonal touchscreenThe initial release of the mobile app will enable users to perform the following functions at a minimum:</p>
                    <p>- Monitor and adjust the refrigerator and freezer temperature</p>
                    <p>- View a live video feed of the inside of the fridge</p>

                <p>- Respond to a series of 5 questions about the user's smart watch needs and preferences</p>
                <p>- Present a rank ordered and scored set of recommended smart watches for consideration</p>
