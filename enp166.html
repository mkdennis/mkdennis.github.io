                <h2>Week 5: Boston Marathon iPad App</h2>
                <p>We authorize you to proceed with the developing initial UI design concepts for an iPad-optimized Boston
Marathon app. As we explained during our initial meeting, we want to create an iPad application that is
distinct from our current mobile application and is more geared to people who want to follow-along from
home. For now, you can assume the application will run on the current generation iPad (9.7″ Retina
display with 2048×1536 resolution)."</p>

                    <li>View a countdown to the start of the race</li>
                    <li>Have runner profiles with mile split times + charity they are running for</li>
