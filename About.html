                <p>Hi I'm Dennis. During my time at university, I've had the opportunity to study a wide range of topics including business, international affairs, philosophy, but mainly cognitive psychology and computer science.</p>
                <p>Interdisciplinary by nature (I'm usually into a million different things at any given time) my approach to designing products involves connecting the dots between multiple perspectives and solutions.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I'm either designing layouts for the Observer, building my school's Korean Student community, and most recently learning how to spin the ones and twos. Thanks for dropping by!</p>
