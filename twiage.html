            <h2>Case Study: Landing Page</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>As the first thing that potential clients will see, the landing page is a crucial entry point for explaining the product, communicating the company's brand mesage, and hopefully garner enough interest to compel customers to sign up for a demo. With a designer now on board, the team decided that it was about time the site had a redesign.</p>
        </div>
        

         <div class = "background f5 w-60-ns sans-serif fn mt5 tc center cf fade lh-copy">
            <p>Upon first glance, the old site looked flat and outdated.</p>

                <div class = "fade">
                    <p class = "fade mv4">Stylistic improvements aside, the main problems of the old site was that it was failing to get signups. This could be due to a variety of reasons but the ones I suspected was its lack of call to actions, confusion as to who the product was for and how it could help.</p>

                    <p>So, the three main questions I set out to answer before designing:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class = "mv2">Who are the user groups that are coming to the site and what are they looking for? - <b>User research</b></li>
                        <li class = "mv2">Are the user groups able to understand the product and see how they might use the product in their own workflows after reading through the site? - <b>Usability</b></li>
                        <li class = "mv2">What specific styles/themes appeal to emergency health professionals? - <b>Branding/Marketing</b></li>
                    </ol>

                <h3 class = "mt5 mb0">User Research</h3>
                <hr>

                <p>Who are the user groups that are coming to the site and what are they looking for?</p>
                <p>I had the opportunity to sit in on a few focus groups with paramedics who use the app as well as sales pitches to hospital ED directors. While listening in and feverishly taking notes and asking questions throughout, I was able to get a better picture of who I was designing for and what their needs might be when looking for a product.</p>

                <p>The three main user groups I was designing for: </p>
                <div class = "bg-gray w-100" style = "height: 300px"></div>
                <p>Are the user groups able to understand the product and see how they might use the product in their own workflows after reading through the site?</p>
 
                <div class = "bg-gray w-100" style = "height: 300px"></div>

                <p class = "fade">Before designing, I knew that while I’ve had plenty of exposure to landing pages for general SASS products, I’ve had much less exposure to digital healthcare. Therefore I conducted a competitive analysis in order to get a better sense of the industry.</p>

                <div class = "bg-gray w-100" style = "height: 300px"></div>
                 </div> -->

                 <h3>Design Process</h3>
                 <p>Design goals:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>User should know what the Twiage product is and how it works after reading through landing page.
                        </li>
                        <li>User should know the difference between the various Twiage products and how they work together</li>
                        <li>User should be able to understand how using the product might work in their own workflows thus persuading the user into wanting the product</li>
                        <Li>Encourage user to sign up for a demo or contact us</Li>
                        <li>Communicate fast paced, emergency brand image and achieve consistency throughout marketing language</li>
                    </ol>

                <h3>Iteration + Incorporating Team Feedback</h3>
                <p>In order to ensure that what I was creating was what the team was envisioning, I organized a series of website critques/style brainstorming sessions.</p>

                <img src= "images/moodboard.png" alt="site critique form" width = "400px" class = "center db">

                <p>Hearing everyone's feedback was immensely helpful for my work moving forward. The team eventually settled on the following:</p>
                <p>BOLD, Powerful, Simple, Hassle free, Speed, Efficient, Privacy, Trust, Secure</p>

                 <h2 class = "tc">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>After many, many hours of iterating, implementing, and figuring out Flexbox, the site was ready to be deployed. The project was my first real go at web design so I’m thankful for the time, support, and patience from my supervisor YiDing and the Twiage team.</p>

                    <li><b>How to ask for constructive feedback</b></li>

        <!-- <div class = "section">

            <h2>What I'd do differently</h2>
                <p>I performed a lot of initial research on the target users before designing the site but wasn’t able to get data on how users currently think of the website. With more time and resources, I would have liked to perform some usability testing.</p>
                <p>Because I had to work around the Wordpress template theme, I spent a lot of time working around the template and Wordpress content editor, when I could’ve spent more time iterating and improving upon my designs. I also could not figure out a way to incorporate javascript which could have added more snazz and interactivity to the site.</p>

            <h2>STAT App Release</h2>
            <p>My internship coincided with the release of the new mobile STAT app to be used by emergency room staff. In preparation of the release, I ideated/prototyped multiple interaction design solutions in response to early testing user feedback, actively communicating with the product owner and developers along the way. The work is covered by an NDA so please reach out (dennis.kim@tufts.edu) if you'd like to know more.</p>
