                <h1>Jumbocode</h1>
                <p>Jumbocode is a Tufts student-run club that provides software services for local non-profit organizations. For the fall of 2017 I worked as the primary UI designer on a team of 10 to create a  mobile app for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>During the winter months the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter sends out Street Teamers to hand out food and supplies to those in need. Additionally, the volunteers help guests call the center in order to register for that night's shelter lottery. In the event that a guest was unable to get a winning number, the street team members have to go back out, inform the guests that they did not receive a bed, and provide any information or resources to help them through the night.</p>
        <p>Due to the number of things the street teamers have to keep track of, it's not uncommon for them to forget by the time they have to record logs for the night.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>This project is still a work in progress. While most of the initial design work has been completed, I plan on making further iterations based on user feedback. Also time withstanding, I would love to perform a usability test or even a contextual inquiry during a street teamer shift. Fingers crossed for a successful release come next semester!</p>
