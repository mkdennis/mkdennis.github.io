                        <p class = "fw5 lh-copy">Jumbocode is a Tufts student-run club that provides software services for local non-profit organizations. For the 2017-2018 school year I worked as the lead UX designer on a team of 10 to create a  mobile app for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.</p>

            <p class = "fade">During the cold winter months the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter sends out a Street Team to provide assistance to those in need who cannot make it to the shelter. This assistance can take the form of providing food and supplies or helping to call in to the shelter's lottery system.</p>

            <p class = "fade">Before coming to Jumbocode, the Street team data and notes system was fairly inefficient: volunteers would take binders of resources and notepads out on the streets and compiled the notes at the end of the night. Due to the number of things the street teamers have to keep track of, it is not uncommon for them to forget by the time they have to record logs.</p>

            <p class = "fade">In order to streamline the note taking process as well as make things run more smoothly for volunteers, our JumboCode team was tasked with creating a mobile app for the shelter.

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>Our initial research came in the form of weekly skype calls with me, our team's PM, the current shelter director as well as a past director. During these calls we were able to gain more information about what the process was like both on the volunteer side and the higher level administrative side. Hearing the director's anecdotes and learning about the volunteer's needs in certain scenarios proved very helpful for our app development.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>At the end of night report, volunteers have trouble remembering certain key events during street run session. Additionally, the end of night reporting process is tedious with many input boxes. During our field research we found volunteers giving low quality data in their reports ("Met two guys tonight") because they wanted to rush through the process. These notes provide important information for future volunteer runs i.e. "avoid 32nd street, people by the COOP bookstore were really thankful for the blankets we gave them". The information is also given to the ED who includes this information in their funding proposals.

                <hr>
                <p>Like many shelters, the HSHS uses a lottery number system to distribute spots for their limited amount of beds. After 11am each day, guests receive their number either by stopping by the shelter or calling into their hotline. At 6pm, the winning numbers are released, however, it can be difficult for guests to find out this information due to an inability to access a phone and call or abandon their belongings to come to the shelter. Street teamers during their resource distribution will generally call in for the guests, however this requires the coordinator to be on constant alert for calls.</p>

                <p>Additionally street teamers will occassionally run out of a particular resource on their first pass through the Harvard neighborhood. On their second pass through the neighborhood it can be difficult to remember the location of the guests and their specific resource request.</p>

                <p>Many of the guests live in the surrounding neighborhood and regularly stay at the shelter. It would be helpful to be able to form long term relationships with these guests to identify any trends or _____, However, because different sets of volunteers go out every night/semester, there is little to no continuation of valuable knowledge about previous nights' reports.

            <h2>Visual Identity + Design System</h2>
            <p>After we got the go ahead from our PM and the director ED I was tasked with creating the visual language for the rest of the project.</p>
            <p>The developers on the team gave me full autonomy on the design side which meant if I was able to design it, they would try their best to implement it exactly which meant my designs had to be close to final product fidelity.</p>

                <p><b>Color: </b>Dealing with vunerable populations requires a level of softness. This is reflected in the guest profile color pallete as well as the general calm app aesthetic.</p>
                <p><b>Reusable Components: </b>Because of the app's complexity + multitude of entry points for the same function, I thought it was extremely important to use the exact same visual components from screen to screen. The action item for instance look the same across screens even though they are for different use cases. Once a user learns how to use a certain piece of UI, it will be easier to understand it in a different context. </p>
                <p>From a developer's perspective, reusable components make things alot easier. React Native is especially good at being able to reuse the same UI components for different screens.</p>
                <p><b>Simplicity for each screen:</b> Each screen contains at maximum 4 visual components as well as one or two main functions. It is important not to overwhelm the user with too much stimuli as we want the user to use the app quickly and frequently. </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>After two semesters of researching, designing, iterating, breaking + fixing code we were able to launch the app in May 2018. It was a time-swalloiwng project but it was nonetheless very fulfilling to be able to use technology for a humane cause.</p>
