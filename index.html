                        <p>Hi! My name is Dennis and I'm a Korean-American product designer based in Washington D.C. Back in school I studied cognitive psychology/HCI which  developed my ability to empathize and design for user needs, taking into consideration both a person's cognitive limitations and how emotional context affects behavior. </p>

                        <p>I spent the past year and a half creating <a href="http://instagram.com/corridorcoffeedc">Corridor Coffee</a>. Now currently looking for opportunities to use design thinking and deliver user friendly, value generating digital products. <a href="mailto: denniskim14@gmail.com">I'd love to hear from you</a> (song recommendations are always welcome ðŸ’½)</p>

	                        <p>Ever since I was a kid Iâ€™ve had a considerable curiosity about people and their lives. I love learning about what people do for work and why, how they tick, what makes them excited/frustrated, how their hometown/life experiences shaped who they are today, their goals and aspirations.</p>
	                    	<p>In a user research context I believe that creating a more holistic model of the user generally leads to alternative models to think of the problem at hand and more opporunities for creative design solutions. Some methods I use:</p>
	                        <p><b>User Interviews:</b> With a list of prepared questions and target information I want to find out, my interview approach is to make the user feel comfortable and confident with sharing their viewpoints and information about the product.</p>
	                        <p><b>Contextual Inquiry:</b> What better way to learn what a user does for work then actually going their workplace and seeing for yourself? In the past Iâ€™ve visited emergency rooms to observe charge nurses and doctors, fire department stations, makeup events, and gone out as a volunteer to serve the Harvard Square homeless population.</p>
	                        <p><b>Usability/Hypothesis Testing:</b> As an experimenter and participant, much of my academic experience has taught me how to conduct quality experiment design to justify assumptions or uncover unexpected outcomes. I try to come up with a testable hypothesis for what works/doesn't work about a digital product and design an experiment to test the hypothesis.</p>
