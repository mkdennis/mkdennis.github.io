                <p>Hi I'm Dennis. During my time at university, I've had the opportunity to study a wide range of topics including business, international affairs, philosophy, but most of my time has been spent studying the intersection between design, cognitive psychology, and computer science.</p>
                <p>Interdisciplinary by nature (I'm usually into a million different things at any given time) my approach to designing products involves connecting the dots between multiple perspectives and solutions. I love having indepth conversations with users and stakeholders to get to the nitty gritty of the problem at hand.</p>

                <p>The design principles I use are derived from books and articles I've read, most notably: <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289062.About_Face_3">About Face</a> by Alan Cooper, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited">Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Kruger, Julie Zhuo's <a href = "https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638#.wqu90m8pk">Medium posts</a>, and the lessons over at <a href = "https://hackdesign.org/lessons">Hackdesign.org.</a>
                </p>
                <p>Outside of the classroom, I'm either designing layouts for the Observer, building my school's Korean student community, and most recently learning how to DJ. Thanks for dropping by!</p>
