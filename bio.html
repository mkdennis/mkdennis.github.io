                <p>Hi I'm Dennis. During my time at university, I've had the opportunity to study a wide range of topics including business, international affairs, philosophy, but most of my time has been spent studying the intersection between design, cognitive psychology, and computer science.</p>
                <p>Interdisciplinary by nature (I'm usually into a million different things at any given time) my approach to designing products involves connecting the dots between multiple perspectives and solutions. I love having indepth conversations with users and stakeholders to get to the nitty gritty of the problem at hand. What makes you laugh? What technology products get you excited? What do you like about your job? How often do you remember to do that thing you needed to do? What makes you tick?</p>

                <p>The design principles I use are derived from books and articles I've read, most notably: <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289062.About_Face_3">About Face</a> by Alan Cooper, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited">Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Kruger (pictured left), Julie Zhuo's <a href = "https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638#.wqu90m8pk">Medium posts</a>, and the lessons over at <a href = "https://hackdesign.org/lessons">Hackdesign.org.</a> I'm also a big fan of the podcast <a href = "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/design-details/id947191070?mt=2">Design Details</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU3y-5Peh9A">High Resolution</a>.
