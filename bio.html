                <p>Hello! My name is Dennis Kim and I'm currently a senior cognitive science student at Tufts University. I'm super fascinated by user behavior and using data/research to design and solve problems &#40; I guess you could call this UI/UX but who knows what that means nowadays	&#41; I'm currently looking for a summer internship in product design/management. Thanks for dropping by! &#x1f601; </p>
