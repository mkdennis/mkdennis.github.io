                <p>Hello! My name is Dennis Kim and I'm currently a senior cognitive science student at Tufts University. I'm super fascinated by user behavior and using data/research to design and solve problems. I'm currently looking for a summer internship in product design. Thanks for dropping by! &#x1f601; </p>
