                <h1 class>Harvard Square Homeless Shelter</h1>
                <p>Jumbocode is a Tufts student-run club that provides software services for local non-profit organizations. For the fall of 2017 I worked as the primary UI designer on a team of 10 to create a  mobile app for the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>During the cold winter months the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter sends out a Street Team to provide assistance to those in need who cannot make it to the shelter. This assistance can take the form of providing food and supplies or helping to call in to the shelter's lottery system.
        <p>Before coming to Jumbocode, the Street team data and notes system was fairly inefficient: volunteers would take binders of resources and notepads out on the streets and compiled the notes at the end of the night. Due to the number of things the street teamers have to keep track of, it is not uncommon for them to forget by the time they have to record logs.</p>
         <p>In order to streamline the note taking process as well as make things run more smoothly for volunteers, our JumboCode team was tasked with creating a mobile app for the shelter.</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
         <p>Our initial research came in the form of weekly skype calls with me, our team's PM, the current shelter director as well as a past director. During these calls we were able to gain more information about what the process was like both on the volunteer side and the higher level administrative side. Hearing the director's anecdotes and learning about the volunteer's needs in certain scenarios proved very helpful for our app development.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project is still a work in progress. While most of the initial design work has been completed, I plan on making further iterations based on user feedback. Also time withstanding, I would love to perform a usability test or even a contextual inquiry during a street teamer shift. Fingers crossed for a successful release come next semester!</p>
